## ðŸŒŸ Overview

Hilbert is a comprehensive language learning application aiming to provide a balanced learning experience among 4 key areas: vocabulary, grammar, reading and writing. The app is designed with a strong community-driven focus, allowing users to play a direct role in creating and enriching its learning resources.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Hilbert is not yet in production. You can use it locally by following these steps:
1. Ensure you have installed: Docker, Docker Compose, Java JDK 21, Maven, PostgreSQL.
2. Fetch the repository and open a terminal in the root.
3. Run a PostgreSQL server. In the `backend` directory, create an `.env` from the `.env.example`, changing the postgres password.
4. You need to build the Docker image of the main backend service, `hilbert-main`. To do this, run `cd backend/hilbert-main`, `mvn clean package -DskipTests`, `docker build -t hilbert-main .` If you also want to use the translation or chatbot functionality, build `hilbert-ml` as well (skipping the Maven step as it is a Python project).
5. From `root/backend`, run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`. The services should be up and running now.
6. Lastly, run the web frontend: `cd web-frontend`, `ng serve`. You can now access the app at `localhost:4200`. Alternatively, run the mobile React Native frontend.

## Status

In mid stages of development.
